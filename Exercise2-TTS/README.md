# **Building a Vietnamese Text-to-Speech (TTS) Model**
## **Proposed Pipeline**
### **1. Data Collection**
#### **Objective:** Gather a high-quality dataset for Vietnamese.
- **Dataset Components:**
  - **Text Corpus**: A diverse collection of Vietnamese text from literature, news articles, and conversational data.
  - **Audio Corpus**: High-quality recordings of native Vietnamese speakers reading the text corpus.
  
- **Datasets Available for TTS Vietnamese:**
  - **VIVOS (Vietnamese Speech Corpus)**: A large corpus of Vietnamese speech data with diverse speakers, though it may not fully represent all regional accents.
  - **VnTTS (Vietnamese TTS Dataset)**: A dedicated dataset for TTS, with thousands of hours of Vietnamese speech.
  - **VoxCeleb**: A large speaker verification dataset with audio from multiple speakers, though primarily in English, it could be adapted for TTS purposes if Vietnamese audio is available.
  
#### **Challenges and Solutions:**
- **Challenge:** Lack of publicly available Vietnamese datasets.
  - **Solution:** Partner with Vietnamese linguists and media organizations to create custom datasets.
- **Challenge:** Regional accent variations.
  - **Solution:** Record datasets for each major dialect and allow accent selection in the TTS output.
- **Challenge:** Inconsistent quality and size of available datasets.
  - **Solution:** Use data augmentation techniques or combine multiple datasets to create a larger, more robust dataset.

### **2. Preprocessing**
#### **Steps:**
1. **Text Normalization:** Clean and normalize text (e.g., expand abbreviations, convert numbers into words).
2. **Phoneme Extraction:**
   - Convert text into phonemes using a Vietnamese-specific grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model.
   - Handle tonal diacritics and syllable segmentation.
3. **Audio Alignment:**
   - Align text with audio using forced alignment algorithms (e.g., Montreal Forced Aligner).

#### **Challenges and Solutions:**
- **Challenge:** Handling Vietnamese tonal rules.
  - **Solution:** Encode tone as a feature in the phoneme representation.
- **Challenge:** Lack of phonetic alignment tools for Vietnamese.
  - **Solution:** Develop or adapt open-source tools for Vietnamese phoneme alignment.

### **3. Model Architecture**
#### **Suggested Models:**
1. **End-to-End TTS Model:** Tacotron 2
   - Converts text (or phonemes) to spectrograms, followed by a vocoder for audio synthesis.
2. **Vocoder:** HiFi-GAN or WaveGlow
   - Converts spectrograms to high-quality speech audio.

#### **Pipeline:**
- **Input:** Preprocessed text (phoneme + tone embeddings).
- **Text-to-Spectrogram:** Train Tacotron 2 or similar model on Vietnamese text-audio pairs.
- **Spectrogram-to-Audio:** Use a vocoder like HiFi-GAN for natural audio synthesis.

### **4 Training and Fine-Tuning**
#### **Steps:**
1. Train the TTS model on the collected dataset.
2. Fine-tune on regional accents for personalization.
3. Validate using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and phoneme accuracy metrics.

#### **Challenges and Solutions:**
- **Challenge:** High computation cost.
  - **Solution:** Use pre-trained TTS models as a base and fine-tune for Vietnamese.
- **Challenge:** Overfitting on specific accents.
  - **Solution:** Regularize training and use a diverse dataset.
